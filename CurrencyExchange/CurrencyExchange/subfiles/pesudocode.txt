- class called "exchange"
    - subclass for "country" w/params for country name & a vector w/its exchange rates
    - function called vecIni() that will init 10 countries 
    - function to display welcoming msg w/the exchange rates for those first 10 countries

- function main() 
    - displays the welcoming msg THEN adds 2 more countries (w/their exchange rates) to the exchange vector (which should now have 12 country vectors in it)
    - outer loop to continue the program y/n 
        - inside this loop, pick country, input amt to convert, output converted currency


PROF PSEUDOCODE EX:

Loop:
    - exchange_list()
    - country_list()
    - foreign_convert()
    - country_convert()
    
- constructor w/the countries- 
- function to push el to vector
- private should have two vectors: exchange (w/doubles) and countries (w/strings)

- then in main, call out the objects from the files, initialize
- main should follow the flow of the creation
- write the main f'n first so that everyone understands how the flow is supposed to look and construct the functions around it
