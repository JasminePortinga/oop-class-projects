# Using GitHub

since i can't seem to change which git credentials i have stored on my laptop i am simply going to have to politely ask you both to not look at my repositories of nonsense (or at least never speak of them to me) when i make commits from my personal account or else i will tank our next project grade on purpose.

anyway, github is where coders keep their repositories of code. you Will use it in your professional life, but some schools don't teach it for some reason. it has kind of a steep learning curve.

this is a github repository. notice all the tabs up at the top.

![code / issues / pull requests / actions / projects / wiki](https://github.com/JasminePortinga/oop-class-projects/blob/main/docs/img/2.png)

the only tabs we are going to care about are `code` and `pull requests`. `code` is where you can look at the code, and `pull requests` will be how we share code with one another, through making code branches and merging them when necessary.

i haven't made any separate branches at the moment because i'm scribbling this together really fast. but how i'd like this to work is that we each have our own separate working branches
